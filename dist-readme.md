# Toggle Sprint v1.0.0

Toggle Sprint is a Silksong mod that lets you keep sprinting without holding down the Dash key as
long as you're holding a movement key.

## Installation

To install Toggle Sprint, place the `ToggleSprint` folder (containing `ToggleSprint.dll`) in your
`BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Usage

Pressing the Dash key while holding down a movement key will stick the Dash key down, and it will
remain pressed until all movement keys are released. Pressing the Dash key again while holding
movement keys will toggle it back off.

Toggle Sprint can be configured by editing `Esper89.ToggleSprint.cfg` in your `BepInEx/config`
folder, or (if you have Configuration Manager installed) in-game by pressing the **F1** key.

## Repository

Toggle Sprint's source code and documentation can be found in its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Esper89/Silksong-ToggleSprint).
