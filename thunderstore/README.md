Toggle Sprint lets you keep sprinting without holding down the Dash key as long as you're holding a
movement key.

## Installation

This mod requires
[BepInEx 5](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong), and is
installed to your `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
[Configuration
Manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/Yukikaco/BepinExConfigurationManager)
can be used with this mod.

## Usage

Once this mod is installed, by default, pressing the Dash key while holding down a movement key will
stick the Dash key down, and it will remain pressed until all movement keys are released. Pressing
the Dash key again while holding movement keys will toggle it back off.

This mod can be disabled by editing its config file or using Configuration Manager to set
`General.Enabled = false`.
